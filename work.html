        <h1>Unit Testing p5.js</h1>
        <p>p5.js is a client-side JS platform that empowers artists, designers,
           students, and anyone to learn to code and express themselves creatively
           on the web.<br>
            This project focuses on improving the unit tests as well as creating
           a more complete unit test coverage for p5.js. This project also
           includes creating a tutorial for new contributors, covering the basics
            of unit testing for p5.js and how to write and add them. <br>
          I am working with Mocha, a powerful testing framework that executes
          individual test files which are specific to p5.js; mocha-chrome, a mocha
           plugin that runs mocha tests using headless Google Chrome;
           Chai.js assert, is used as a guide for phrasing assertion messages so
           that any errors caught by the tests in the future will be consistent
           and consequently easier for other developers to understand.

        <h3>Google Summer of Code</h3>
        <p>May '19 - Present</p>
        <p>Google Summer of Code is a global program focused on
          bringing more student developers into open source
          software development. Students work with an open
          source organization on a 3 month programming
          project during their break from school.</p><br>
        <h3>The Processing Foundation</h3>
        <p>Initially created to serve as a software sketchbook and to teach
          programming fundamentals within a visual context, Processing has
          evolved into a new medium for professionals and students alike. The
          Processing software is free and open source, and runs on the Mac,
          Windows, and GNU/Linux platforms.</p>

        <h1>Improve support for photo/media contribution campaigns on Wikimedia Programs & Events Dashboard</h1>
        <p>The Wiki Education Dashboard / Programs & Events Dashboard helps
          people organize groups of newcomers who volunteer their time and hard
          work to contribute to Wikipedia. It is used by the global Wikipedia
          Education Program for Wikipedia writing assignments in college and high
          school classes, the Art + Feminism editathon campaign, and many other
          thematic in-person and online outreach projects.<br>
          This project focused on improving the support for photo/media
          contribution campaigns. A user research was conducted with
          Wikimedians who organize photo campaigns to identify and prioritize
          additional improvements and thus a new interface for
          viewing photo uploads was designed and built.
